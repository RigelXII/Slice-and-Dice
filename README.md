# Slice-and-Dice
Pie Gambling

The creation of this site was to further solidify my knowledge of HTML and Javascript programming. There are a lot of improvements that could be made but I think it has served its purpose.

Instructions:
1. Enter a type of pie into the input field and click the "Slice!" button.
2. You will be given hints as to what inputs will create unique outputs.
3. Once the dice game has been unlocked, move the slider to change your odds and reward multiplier.
4. Your free slice of pie is at stake. Make bets by clicking the "Bet" button and see how many slices you can rack up.
